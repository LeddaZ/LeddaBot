# EmojiBot
Discord bot that replaces text in messages with regional indicator emojis

## Usage

If the string contains spaces it has to be enclosed in quotation marks, like this:

`!emoji "string with spaces"`

**NOTE: It's recommended to use the latest dev release of pycord (read [here](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/installing.html#installing)) until 2.0 is released**
